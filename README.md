## ⚠️ Notice

**_Lyne Components_ are 🧪experimental at the moment — with enthusiasm.<br>Don't use the project until it has left infancy.**

<br>

## 💻 What we're working on right now

Check the current tasks we're working on over [here](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne-components/projects/4) but since the project is still **🧪 experimental** and in rapid development not all tasks we're working on are reflected as issues (or tickets) since this would be too cumbersome at the current development stage. Also check out over [TODOS](./TODOS.md) what all needs to be done (at some point).

## Browser and screen reader support

This library supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers: Chrome (including Android), Firefox, Safari (including iOS), and Edge.

We aim for great user experience with the following screen readers:

Windows: NVDA and JAWS with FF / Chrome.
macOS: VoiceOver with Safari / Chrome.
iOS: VoiceOver with Safari
Android: Android Accessibility Suite (formerly TalkBack) with Chrome.
