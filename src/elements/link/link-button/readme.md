The `sbb-link-button` component provides the same functionality as a native `<button>`,
despite its appearance as a link enhanced with the SBB Design.

## Slots

The text is provided via an unnamed slot.

```html
<sbb-link-button value="help"> Help </sbb-link-button>
```

## States

The component can be displayed in `disabled` state using the self-named property.

```html
<sbb-link-button disabled>Refunds</sbb-link-button>
```

## Button properties

The component is internally rendered as a button,
accepting its associated properties (`type`, `name`, `value` and `form`).

```html
<sbb-link-button name="tickets" form="buy" value="tickets">
  Travel-cards and tickets
</sbb-link-button>
```

## Accessibility

### Interactive disabled buttons

Native disabled elements cannot receive focus and do not dispatch any events. This can
be problematic in some cases because it can prevent the app from telling the user why the button is
disabled. Consumers can use the `disabledInteractive` property to receive focus and dispatch events.
The button will have `aria-disabled="true"` for assistive technology.
It is the consumers responsibility to provide a reason for the element being disabled.
This can be achieved by adding an `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute.

**Note:** Using the `disabledInteractive` property can result in buttons that previously prevented
actions to no longer do so, for example a submit button in a form. When using this input, you should
guard against such cases in your component.
