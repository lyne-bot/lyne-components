The `sbb-container` is a component that

```html
<sbb-container>
  <!-- Any other kind of content. -->
  <sbb-title>...</sbb-title>
  <p class="sbb-text-s">...</p>
  ...

  <!-- Sticky bar should go last. -->
  <sbb-sticky-bar> ... </sbb-sticky-bar>
</sbb-container>
```

## Style

The component has two spacing variants, that can be set using the `expanded` property (default: `false`). This spacing is applied to all of its content, including the `sbb-sticky-bar`.

```html
<sbb-container expanded> ... </sbb-container>
```
