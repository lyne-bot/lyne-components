# sbb-alert-group

The `sbb-alert-group` manages the dismissal and accessibility of alerts and also its visual gap between each other.

```html
<sbb-alert-group accessibility-title='Disruptions' accessibility-level='2'>
    <sbb-alert
      title-content='Interruption between GenÃ¨ve and Lausanne'
      href='https://www.sbb.ch'
      size='l'
    >
      The rail traffic between Allaman and Morges is interrupted. All trains are cancelled.
    </sbb-alert>
    <sbb-alert title-content='Interruption between Berne and Olten' href='https://www.sbb.ch'>
      Between Berne and Olten from 03.11.2021 to 05.12.2022 each time from 22:30 to 06:00 o'clock
      construction work will take place. You have to expect changed travel times and changed
      connections.
    </sbb-alert>
  </sbb-alert-group>
```

## Accessibility
By specifying the `accessibility-title` it's possible to add a hidden title to the `sbb-alert-group`. 
The heading level can be set via `accessibility-title-level`.

As default the `sbb-alert-group` has the role `alert` which means that if a new alert arrives,
it will be immediately announced to screen reader users. You can change the `role` or `aria-live` attributes to fit your needs.
For example, you can set the `role` to `status` which implicitly sets `aria-live` to `polite`.
If all alerts are dismissed, it's recommended to completely remove the `sbb-alert-group` from DOM. 
You can catch this moment by listening to `sbb-alert-group_empty` event and react accordingly.
