# sbb-card

The `sbb-card` component is a generic content container as an action element; its task is to contain HTML elements related to a single subject.

Internally, it is either rendered as an anchor (`<a>`, when used with a `href` attribute) or as a button (when used without a `href` attribute). When rendered as a button, it is possible to listen to the click event to add behavior.

There are six size variants available (from `xs` to `xxl`), which can be configured via the `size` attribute value,
and two background variants, white by default and milk when the `color` attribute is set to `milk`.
Set the `active` attribute to display the card in an active state, which is bordered and has no hover effect.

The `sbb-card-badge` component can be used via slot to display a badge in the upper right corner. 
The badge is hidden with sizes `xs` or `s`.

## Usage

The examples below shows how to use the component with and without the `<sbb-card-badge>` component.
In the first one, the `sbb-card` will be internally rendered as a button, in the second one as a link. 

```html
<sbb-card size="xl" color="milk">
  <sbb-card-badge slot="badge" appearance="primary" is-discount></sbb-card-badge>
  Card content
</sbb-card>

<sbb-card size="l" href="https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne-components" target="_blank">
  Card content
</sbb-card>
```
