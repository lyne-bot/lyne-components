# sbb-datepicker-next-day

The `sbb-datepicker-next-day` is a component closely connected to the `sbb-datepicker`;
when the two are used together, the `sbb-datepicker-next-day` can be used to choose
the date after the selected date, or tomorrow's date if the date-picker's input has no defined value.

If the two components are used within a `sbb-form-field`, they are automatically linked and
the `sbb-datepicker-next-day` will be projected in the `suffix` slot of the `sbb-form-field`; otherwise,
they can be connected using the `datePicker` property, which accepts the id of the `sbb-datepicker`,
or directly its reference.

The `sbb-datepicker-next-day` has an internal disabled state, which is set looking at the `sbb-datepicker`'s input:
if it is disabled, or if the selected date is equal to the input's `max` attribute, the component is disabled.


## Usage

Without `sbb-form-field`:
```html
    <input id="datepicker-input" />
    <sbb-datepicker id="datepicker" input="datepicker-input"></sbb-datepicker>
    <sbb-datepicker-next-day date-picker="datepicker"></sbb-datepicker-next-day>
```

With `sbb-form-field`:
```html
    <sbb-form-field>
      <input />
      <sbb-datepicker></sbb-datepicker>
      <sbb-datepicker-next-day></sbb-datepicker-next-day>
    </sbb-form-field>
```
