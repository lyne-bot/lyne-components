# CI/CD

## SemVer
We adhere to the semantic versioning standard. With each merge into master, the potential next version is automatically determined by the `sematic-release` package.

Only commits that adhere to the `Conventional Commits` standard ([https://www.conventionalcommits.org/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)) will trigger semantic releases accordingly.

To make sure developers properly style their commit messages, we use `husky` together with `commit-lint`.

## Tools
