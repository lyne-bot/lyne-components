# States

Components can have various states. We want to document which states exist and their definitions.

### Normal

The state when no other state applies.

### Hover

State when mouse is hovering over the component. Does not exist on touch devices.
Should visually highlight the component.
For accessibility compliance, the visual highlight must not be reduced to color, but should either include translation, cursor/pointer change or other effects that make it understandable for visually impaired consumers.

### Focused

State when component or element has focus via keyboard.
Should provide an outline when component has focus (via keyboard).

### Active

State when component or element is active and not a form element.
(e.g. an active tab in a tab group, an expanded accordion panel, an pressed button)
Should visually highlight the component.
For accessibility compliance, the visual highlight must not be reduced to color, but should either include translation, cursor/pointer change or other effects that make it understandable for visually impaired consumers.

### Checked

State when form component or elment is checked.
(e.g. radio-button, checkbox)

Indeterminate is a substate of this.

### Disabled

### Readonly
