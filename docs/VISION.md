# Lyne Design System — Vision

## What _Lyne_ is and why we need it

The _Lyne Design System_ is a holistic approach towards a consistent, maintainable, cross-company design language for all SBB digital products/services for a better common understanding between stakeholders, designers and developers.

## What _Lyne_ consists of

The _Lyne Design System_ is based on an intuitive, unique — the Single Source of Truth — referential resource, including shared and well-documented guidelines, processes and vocabulary, design decisions (so-called Design Tokens), as well as centralized, vendor and framework-agnostic basic building blocks (Lyne Components).

## What _Lyne_ does

The _Lyne Design System_ not only enables an optimized collaboration and integration workflow between the Lyne team and consumers of _Lyne Design System_ but also accelerates the creation and development process (time to market) in a sustainable, maintainable, and long-term committed fashion.

## Risks

General risks of a Design System that we always need to face and be aware of:

- Single Point of Failure (SPoF)
- Fear of harming the designers' creativity
- Governance difficulties
  - Design System rejection/denial
  - Missing adoption
- Documentation — if not well enough documented
- Funding difficulties
